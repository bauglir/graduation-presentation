# Traditional Methods

* Have exponential growth of optimization time in number of parameters

* Require a large number of signals

* Take a long time to find optimal parameters

.notes Exponential growth is an issue that can be handled. Optimization is time-consuming, because evaluation of EL is time-consuming
