# Algorithm Design

* Audio processing algorithms tunable through parameters

* Noise reduction algorithm aimed at improving intelligibility of speech in noise

* Removes noise power from a noisy signal

* Lower bound on suppression \\(\left(G_\text{min}\right)\\)

.notes Algorithm works in the frequency domain and is used for instance in Hearing Instruments
