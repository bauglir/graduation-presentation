# Computer-Aided Algorithm Design

* Problems have _non-analytical_ solutions

* _Knowledge_ is expressed in _equations_

* _Uncertainty_ is captured in _parameters_

* Finding optimal parameters for a given problem can be tedious work

.notes Trade-off between number of equations and degrees of freedom to search through solution space given by number of parameters. Larger parameter spaces are harder to search. But knowledge equations restrict solution space (including possibly invalid assumptions). Typically small number of parameters, since searching the parameter space can be time-consuming.
