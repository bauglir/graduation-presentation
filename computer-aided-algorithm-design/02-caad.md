# Computer-Aided Algorithm Design

* Problems have non-analytical solutions

* Knowledge is captured in equations

* Uncertainty is captured in parameters

.notes Trade-off between number of equations and degrees of freedom to search through solution space given by number of parameters. Larger parameter spaces are harder to search. But knowledge equations restrict solution space (including possibly invalid assumptions). Typically small number of parameters, since searching the parameter space can be time-consuming.
