# Conventional Methods

* DIRECT [Jones _et al._, 1993]

* Competitive optimization method

* Requires a large number of signals

* Takes a long time to find optimal parameters

.notes Exponential growth is an issue that can be handled. Optimization is time-consuming, because evaluation of EL is time-consuming
